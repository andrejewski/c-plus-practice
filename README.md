# C/C++ Practice Problems

This is a collection of little programs I wrote while practicing writing
C/C++ programs. These problems were found online and modified by myself
to make them encompass more challenging concepts.

All solutions are my own work.

## Building and Running

All programs are terminal-based.

Just load this bash function and pick a program to run, like so:

```sh
co() {
  make $1
  ./$1
}
```

```sh
co calculator # builds and runs calculator
```
